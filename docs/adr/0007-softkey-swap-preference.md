# ADR 0007 — A user preference to swap the Left/Right softkeys

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-09

## Context

`AGENTS.md` §4 and `UX-SPEC.md` §2 both state a global, unconditional rule:
LEFT softkey is always Options, RIGHT is always Back — "no screen reassigns a
key to a different meaning." That rule exists to keep the app predictable
across every screen.

Some feature-phone hardware exists (or is configured) with its physical
Left/Right softkeys mounted or wired in reverse of the AOSP default, so the
key that is physically on the left dispatches what the platform reports as
`KEYCODE_SOFT_RIGHT` (or vice versa). On that hardware, the app's own
consistent LEFT=Options mapping becomes *inconsistent with the phone itself*
— Options is reachable on the physical right, Back on the physical left,
with no visual cue why.

## Decision

Add one user preference, `Settings > Advanced > "Swap Left/Right keys"`
(`UserPreferences.softkeysSwapped`, `core/ui`). When on:

- `KeyMap.map(event, swapped)` flips `LogicalKey.SOFT_LEFT`/`SOFT_RIGHT` after
  its normal per-device keycode table, so a physical-left press yields
  `SOFT_RIGHT` and vice versa.
- Every screen's `SoftkeyFragment` still receives `LogicalKey.SOFT_LEFT` as
  "Options" and `SOFT_RIGHT` as "Back" — the swap happens once, centrally, in
  `KeyMap`; no feature code changes meaning.
- The on-screen labels mirror position (`mirroredLabels`,
  `SoftkeyFragment.kt`) so the visible text still matches which physical
  button does what; `SoftkeyBarView`'s tap fallback dispatches to match.
- **`KEYCODE_BACK` is exempt, always.** Some hardware has a dedicated Back
  key distinct from the two labeled positional softkeys — a universal "go
  back" affordance, not one of the two things this preference is about.
  `KeyMap.map` special-cases it before the swap step, unconditionally
  returning `SOFT_RIGHT` regardless of `swapped`. (First shipped without
  this exemption — `KEYCODE_BACK` and `KEYCODE_SOFT_RIGHT` originally shared
  one `LogicalKey` in the per-device table, a fine simplification before
  this preference existed, since they meant the same thing; swapping then
  incorrectly carried the dedicated Back key along with the positional
  right softkey. Fixed same day, on user report.)

This is a **narrow, explicit exception** to the "no screen reassigns a key"
rule, not a repeal of it: the rule is about screens giving LEFT/RIGHT
*different meanings from each other* (e.g. a screen making LEFT mean Back).
This preference doesn't do that — Options is still always reachable via one
softkey and Back via the other; only which *physical* key produces which
*logical* key changes, uniformly, for every screen, at once.

## Rationale

- Centralizing the flip in `KeyMap` (the one file that reads a raw keycode,
  per `AGENTS.md` §4) keeps every downstream consumer — 20+ `SoftkeyFragment`
  subclasses — unaware the preference exists. No screen re-implements it.
- A `StateFlow<Boolean>` read directly (`.value`) at dispatch time, not
  collected/cached: the swap takes effect on the very next key press, no
  Activity recreate needed (unlike the theme preferences, which do recreate
  — this one has no visual chrome to rebuild, just future key events).

## Update (UI improvement plan, Phase 4) — the swapped layout is now the default

Shipped default flipped from off to **on**: `softkeysSwapped` now defaults to
`true`, so a fresh install has Options on the physical right and Back on the
left. This is a distinct decision from the one above — the original
rationale (unconfigured/unreversed hardware) doesn't apply to most devices,
this is simply the preferred default layout going forward, independent of
any particular hardware's wiring. The toggle itself, `KeyMap`'s swap
mechanism, the `KEYCODE_BACK` exemption, and the mirrored on-screen labels
are all unchanged — anyone who prefers the original LEFT=Options/RIGHT=Back
layout flips the same "Swap Left/Right keys" row back off in Settings >
Advanced.

## Update — the swapped default is reverted; Options is on the left again

On-device testing after the Addendum's `AccessibilityService` workaround
shipped showed the physical right softkey still not reliably opening
Options, even with that service enabled — and the workaround itself
requires the user to grant it in system Accessibility settings, which per
user report doesn't reliably take effect on every phone (e.g. Android 13+'s
"restricted settings" protection can silently block a sideloaded app's
toggle). Reachable Options mattered more than the cosmetic preference for a
default layout, so `softkeysSwapped` is reverted to defaulting **off**:
Options is back on the left, Back on the right, out of the box. This
sidesteps the underlying conflict entirely for anyone on the default — the
contested key (`KEYCODE_SOFT_RIGHT`) no longer needs to mean Options at
all, so whatever is or isn't intercepting it stops mattering for a fresh
install.

The toggle, `KeyMap`'s swap mechanism, the `KEYCODE_BACK` exemption, the
mirrored on-screen labels, and the `AccessibilityService` workaround
(Addendum, below) are all unchanged and still available — this only flips
which layout ships unconfigured. Anyone who explicitly turned the swap on
already has that choice persisted and is unaffected either way.

## Addendum — an AccessibilityService workaround for one class of hardware

Diagnosed together with the user via adb logcat on real hardware: on some
devices, the system's own predictive-text ("T9word") keyboard consumes
`KEYCODE_SOFT_RIGHT` before `MainActivity.dispatchKeyEvent` ever sees it, but
ONLY while an EditText/IME is active (composing) — outside of composing,
normal dispatch already works fine. This is a real conflict between two
apps' hardware-key handling, not something fixable by changing what
`KeyMap`/`dispatchKeyEvent` do with an event they never receive in the first
place.

Fix: `MatChatKeyAccessibilityService` (`app/accessibility`), an
`AccessibilityService` requesting `FLAG_REQUEST_FILTER_KEY_EVENTS` — the
documented purpose of that flag is letting a service see hardware keys
earlier in the platform's dispatch pipeline than IME processing does, giving
it a chance to claim the key before the IME can swallow it.

Scope is deliberately as narrow as possible, per explicit user direction:
the service claims **only** the physical right softkey
(`KEYCODE_SOFT_RIGHT`) — not the left softkey, not `MENU`, not the dedicated
`BACK` key. Every other key, including all of a T9 IME's own digit/D-pad/
CENTER input, returns `false` immediately and is completely untouched,
whether or not this service is enabled. A claimed key is handed to
`MainActivity.handleExternalSoftkey` → `handleAccessibilityKeyEvent`, which
runs it through the exact same `KeyMap` + `LogicalKeyReceiver` path
`dispatchKeyEvent` already uses — no parallel/divergent key-handling logic.

Entirely inert unless the user explicitly enables it in system Accessibility
settings (Settings > Advanced > "Softkey helper", a plain link row to the
system screen — the app can't read or set this itself). Landed once before,
reverted for having shipped with no unit-testable seam at all; this version
extracts the one genuinely pure piece (`isInterceptedSoftkey`, the keycode
filter) into a tested top-level function, while the rest — a real
Accessibility-permission grant and a real (or simulated) T9 IME actually
swallowing the key — can only be verified with manual on-device QA, which is
called out explicitly rather than claimed as covered by the test suite.

### Update — TurboText ruled out; a real DOWN/UP consumption bug found and fixed

A sibling app on the same hardware family, TurboText (com.turbotext.app),
was suspected as a competing cause after its own accessibility-based key
service showed up reacting to `KEYCODE_SOFT_RIGHT` in an on-device logcat
capture. Reading its own source (`KeyButtonAccessibilityService`, in its
repo) settled it: that service only ever consumes the key while *Kyocera's
own home screen* is in the foreground, to fix a broken OEM shortcut —
every other foreground app, MatChat included, falls through untouched.
It still logs on every SOFT_RIGHT press system-wide for its own
diagnostics, which is why its lines appeared in the capture; it never
actually intercepts here. Ruled out by design, not just by the earlier,
inconclusive on/off retest.

Comparing the two implementations did turn up a real, previously-unnoticed
bug in `MatChatKeyAccessibilityService`: it consumed a claimed key's DOWN
but unconditionally returned `false` for its matching UP, leaving that UP
orphaned (no DOWN was ever delivered anywhere for it) — TurboText's own
doc comment describes the platform mishandling exactly this on this
hardware family ("Cancelling event due to no window focus"). Fixed the
same way TurboText does: track whether the DOWN was consumed and consume
the matching UP too. Still unconfirmed whether this was the actual cause
of Options not responding — needs the next on-device capture with the
existing `MatChatSoftkey` logging to say for certain.

## Consequences

- `AGENTS.md` §4 carries a named-exception note pointing here.
- Any *future* per-screen key reassignment proposal is still a "stop and
  ask" per `AGENTS.md` §1 — this ADR authorizes exactly this one global,
  uniform swap, not a precedent for screen-specific remapping.
- If a specific device SKU is later found to need this permanently (not as a
  user toggle), that's a `KeyMap` per-device table entry instead, per its own
  existing convention — not a reason to remove this preference, which serves
  a different case (unconfigured/unknown hardware, or a device that's
  reversed but not per-device-detectable).
- The AccessibilityService above is a separate, narrower mitigation for a
  different problem (an IME swallowing the key before dispatch, not a
  reversed physical layout) — the two are independent and can be enabled in
  any combination.
